Synchronizing Codio with Git repo (github or gitlab). 1, 2 . 3: getting a pair of repos. 4: connecting. 5: synchronizing.
RIGHTS MANAGEMENTS:
1. Get my public key :
	https://codio.com/hugolpz > Codio > Account > tab: SSH key
	"We have generated an SSH public and private key pair for you on our servers. 
	Below is your public key. 
	Use this to allow Codio to communicate with external servers over SSH."
2. Added KEYS to my user's account on github/gitlab :
	* https://github.com/settings/ssh
	* http://git.mysite.com/profile/keys
CREATE PAIR OF CONNECTED REPOS:
3. Have a Gihub code? => Create a Codio project:
	* https://codio.com/myname > tab: "Create project"
	* name: <projectname>
	* Git
	Done. Got to 5.
3. Have Codio code? => Create a github/gitlab repo on:
	* https://github.com/new > create repository
	* http://git.mysite.com/projects/new > create project
	> grab the SSH key, such : git@github.com:username/projectname.git
4. Codio.com > project > Tools (tab) > Git < Remotes... : 
	* name: origin
	* SSH key: git@github.com:username/projectname.git
	OR: git remote add origin <ssh_key>
SYNCHRO:
5. git add -A ; git push # syncrhonize with git pull codio<=git or git push: codio=>git

Ok, Boston & the #TCLT8 want a cognitive WebApp? Ok, Let's the hacking start!! @edouard_lopez pic.twitter.com/ERZ3p8suOW 

DATA MODULE: Improved JSON data format a bit. Better this way.
API request to clean up. list > API > utf8 trouble. Use: alert(JSON.stringify(data)); + Not in order > post processing sort() needed! Done!
LOAD-SAVE MODULE: Conditional data loading giving me hard time, I will get it I swear !
Algo was correct, function was broken... Surprise !: #JSON does NOT accept comments through external loading ! #brainfuck #JS #JSON.parse
Conditional data loading then done in 10 mins, naturally !~~ hoyhoy~
All loading working fine, dictionaries & monitoring files loaded as and where expected. The machine is rooling !
Long due SAVE function implemented: data get persistant ! #localStorage is handsome
Let's see the battle map: now time to attack the filter module !
LIST MODULE: Could do better on this filter module, but this is good enough, and done.
API MODULE: Filtering the main dataset from the list of target : smooth, but wait: could be dropt. : )
Wondering: is the [{},{},{}] or the {k:{},k:{},k:{}} data structure better for this project! O0O @edouard_lopez #strore #process #JS #JSON
Well, IndexedDB may be the suitable, heavy solution for persistant storage https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/IndexedDB/Using_IndexedDB
TEMPLATING SIDE: ok, DONE !


MONITORING SIDE: let's go !
Some further fight around the data structure.
SCORING MODULE: 
Data scoring calculations at start : eventually working !
Data sorting & saving at start, Implementation: Done!
Data-UI synchronisation at start, implementation: Done !
